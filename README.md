Tower Of Hanoi Game using HTML, Javascript, and CSS


Describe your project, including what your learned, and if relevent, links to running code:

Andrew and I created a Tower of Hanoi game where the user plays to try and complete the puzzle in the fewest turns possible. The user interacts with the buttons
corresponding to each tower to manipulate the discs, and they can select the amount of discs they would like to have in play. A reset button is present to reload the page,
and a counter displays the total moves that have been played, and the current disc in hand. Andrew and I have worked together developing this game, but specifically, 
Andrew focused on how to move the objects across the stacks after a user click, the move counter, and the win condition. I worked on userinput, setting up the buttons,
and the html dom. Together we built the stack framework. We learned how simple moving objects from stacks can be, and how to take user input in new ways other than from the terminal.
This was our first project of this scale, and we are proud with how it turned out. We also learned how to implement CSS to try and make it look a little nicer.
